                Bethesda expanded upon the main story by adding two more expansion packs that were purchasable in
                addition to the main game. <i> Dawnguard </i> and <i> Dragonborn </i> were released in 2012 for PC,
                Xbox360 and later for PS3.
                In the Dawnguard expansion you join a group of Vampire hunters known as the <i> Dawnguard </i> who are
                at war with Clan Volhikar, a group of ancient Vampires. This expansion was memorable for giving you the
                ability to turn into a Vampire Lord yourself which gave you access to a host of new abilities as well
                as a menacing new look.

                Dragonborn takes your character to the island of Solstheim, an area that was last seen in the third
                expansion <i> Morrowind </i> . It is the home of the Dark Elves who have a unique design to their towns
                and armor. Solstheim itself contrasts sharply to the frozen forests of Skyrim. The land is covered in
                giant mushrooms and caves. The villain of this story is the sorcerer <i> Miraak </i> . Miraak claims to
                be the true dragonborn and sends his cult followers to assassinate you in Skyrim. This expansion gives
                the player a new story to fight through, as well as the ability to ride dragons.
