        <p>
            Bethesda expanded upon the main story by adding two more expansion packs that were purchasable in
            addition to the main game. <i> Dawnguard </i> and <i> Dragonborn </i> were released in 2012 for PC,
            Xbox360 and later for PS3.
            In the Dawnguard expansion you join a group of Vampire hunters known as the <i> Dawnguard </i> who are
            at war with Clan Volhikar, a group of ancient Vampires. This expansion was memorable for giving you the
            ability to turn into a Vampire Lord yourself which gave you access to a host of new abilities as well
            as a menacing new look.

        <p>
            <i> Dragonborn </i> takes your character to the island of Solstheim, an area that was last seen in the
            third
            expansion <i> Morrowind </i> . It is the home of the Dark Elves who have a unique design to their towns
            and armor. Solstheim itself contrasts sharply to the frozen forests of Skyrim. The land is covered in
            giant mushrooms and caves. The villain of this story is the sorcerer <i> Miraak </i> . Miraak claims to
            be the true dragonborn and sends his cult followers to assassinate you in Skyrim. This expansion gives
            the player a new story to fight through, as well as the ability to ride dragons.
