            ABOUT SKYRIM
        <p>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is an action role playing game designed and published by Bethesda studios. It is
            the fifth installment of the Elder Scrolls series. The game was released on PC, xbox 360 and PS3 in
            November of 2011. The game is set in the fictional province of Skyrim which is the northernmost province of
            the continent of Tamriel.The design of the land and people of Skyrim are heavily influenced by Norse
            mythology. The design of the game itself is an open world which gives you the freedom to move about the
            world without having to stay within the boundaries of the main story. I have played many games over the
            years but few have kept my interest the way Skyrim has. The combination of unparalleled world design, as
            well as a thriving scene of modders and enthusiasts always keep things fresh and exciting to this day.</p>
