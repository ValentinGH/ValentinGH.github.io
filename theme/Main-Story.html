        <p>The story begins in the same manner as its predecessors <i>Oblivion</i> and <i> Morrowind.</i>. You
            awake to find yourself a prisoner aboard an Imperial Wagon on its way to the town of Helgen, where you
            and the other passengers are being taken to execution. Hadvar, one of the rebels on the wagon with you
            , tells you that the person sitting next to you is<i> Ulfric Stormcloak</i>, the leader of the
            Stormcloak
            rebellion. </p>

            Once you reach the town of Helgen, you are taken to the execution block in the middle of the town. You
            are interrogated in from of two Imperial officers asking about your identity. This is where you can
            create your character from a wide variety of different races and backgrounds.

        <p>
            Once you have created your character, you are taken to the block to be executed. All hope seems lost…
            that is until the Dragon Alduin The World Eater begins to destroy the town. This is the chance you need
            to run to safety. You somehow manage to escape through an underground fort not just from your captors,
            but the mighty Dragon as well. This is where your open world adventure begins…As you progress through
            the main story you find out that you are <i> Dragonborn </i> .The Dragonborn is a hero in prophecy who
            is said to save the world from the main villain, the Dragon Alduin. You have the soul of a dragon in
            human form which gives you the ability to speak in their native language. The Dragon language is not
            just for speaking . It also gives you access to the Thu’um a magical ability to shout in the dragons’
            tongue. This gives you the player access to unique abilities.
