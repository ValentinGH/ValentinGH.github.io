                Once you have created your character, you are taken to the block to be executed. All hope seems lost…
                that is until the Dragon Alduin The World Eater begins to destroy the town. This is the chance you need
                to run to safety. You somehow manage to escape through an underground fort not just from your captors,
                but the mighty Dragon as well. This is where your open world adventure begins…As you progress through
                the main story you find out that you are <i> Dragonborn </i> .The Dragonborn is a hero in prophecy who
                is said to save the world from the main villain, the Dragon Alduin. You have the soul of a dragon in
                human form which gives you the ability to speak in their native language. The Dragon language is not
                just for speaking . It also gives you access to the Thu’um a magical ability to shout in the dragons’
                tongue. This gives you the player access to unique abilities.
